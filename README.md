# ClassficationAlgorithm
Two applications of two algorithms in the field of classification in the field of data mining. The first is ID3 for constructing a decision tree, the second is for Bayesian conditional probability calculation. The code is in Python. The dataset exists for training and the user is free to choose the target attribute.
One of the available classification algorithms, which is the decision tree algorithm and the Bayesian algorithm, can be applied to the data set. In the datasetTest folder, there are six data sets, and the user can add other data or new records, but the data set must be stored in txt files, and one space is separated between the column and the other. Where the first line represents the attributes (attributes), the remaining lines are the data, and the separator is one space.
